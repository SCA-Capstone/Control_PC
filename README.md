## How it works:

1. **Download the C++ file:** The script uses `curl` to fetch the C++ source file from a specified URL.
2. **Compile the C++ file:** The file is compiled using `g++`, and the output binary is saved with a specified name.
3. **Upload the compiled file:** The compiled output is uploaded to a remote server using `scp`.

## Usage:

### Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x process_cpp.sh

## Setting up the script to run once every 24 hours

1. Open the cron table by running:

    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

2. Add the following line to the file to run the script every 24 hours (at midnight, for example):

    ```bash
    0 0 * * * /path/to/your/process_cpp.sh
    ```

   This will execute the script located at `/path/to/your/process_cpp.sh` every day at midnight.

3. Save and exit the crontab editor.

## Explanation:

- `0 0 * * *`: This cron schedule means "run at 00:00 (midnight) every day."
- `/path/to/your/process_cpp.sh`: Replace this with the full path to your script.
